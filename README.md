# Dart Asynchronous Operation Error Handling

This example showcases robust error handling in Dart when dealing with asynchronous operations like network requests or file I/O.  It covers the important aspects:

- **Specific Exception Handling:**  The code includes `try-catch` blocks for `TimeoutException`, `SocketException`, and `Exception`.  This provides targeted error handling and allows for different responses based on the type of failure.
- **General Exception Handling:** A catch-all `catch (e)` block captures unexpected errors.
- **Finally Block:** A `finally` block ensures cleanup actions (like closing resources) always execute, even if exceptions occur.
- **Error Messages:**  Clear and informative error messages are printed to the console.

This approach helps to build more resilient and reliable Dart applications.
